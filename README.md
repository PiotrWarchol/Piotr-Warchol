I'm Piotr, and I currently work as a Programmer Analyst that focuses on Mainframe development with COBOL. I studied Artificial Intelligence in my masters program and find that that is what I am most passionate about when it comes to tech. I want to take some of the software skills that I have acquired in my current job and marry them with the tools and skills that I have acquired in my masters program and use GitHub to help showcase that.

Skills: Python / SQL / COBOL / JCL
